            <ul>
                <li class="fragment" data-fragment="cube">Here's (a representation of) a box.</li>
                <li class="fragment" data-fragment="grid">It exists in 3-dimensional space.</li>
                <li class="fragment" data-fragment="choppy">
                    We can animate its movement by drawing it repeatedly in
                    different positions.
                </li>
                <li class="fragment" data-fragment="smoother">
                    <p>
                        By drawing it more frequently in more positions the
                        movement is smoother and the animation nicer to watch.

                        One way to ensure this is to keep a high framerate. We
                        already do that here using <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code>
                        so the other factor is to make sure the positions at
                        which the box is rendered are continuous.
                    </p>
